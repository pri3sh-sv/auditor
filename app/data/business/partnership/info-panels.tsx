          The Indian Partnership Act, 1932 states that registration of a partnership firm appears rather than compulsory. It is entirely up to the partners' decision and is entirely voluntary. The business can be documented as a firm kind of formation or incorporation at any stage during the partnership.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          However, registering the partnership firm as a registered firm with specific rights and privileges over unregistered firms is always a good idea; it protects your interests legally.

            To exercise his rights emanating from a contract against a partner or the partnership firm, a partner can sue any other partner or the partnership firm. Partners in an unregistered partnership firm cannot sue the firm or other partners to enforce their rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            The registered firm can initiate a lawsuit against any third party to enforce a contract right. An unregistered firm cannot file a lawsuit against a third party to enforce a right. On the other hand, any third party can sue the unregistered firm without restriction.
          </li>
          <li>
            The registered firm can seek set-off or other legal action to enforce a contractual entitlement. In any litigation against it, the unregistered company cannot claim set-off.

          One of the most meaningful types of organizations is partnership. A partnership firm is formed when two or more people create a business and agree to split the profits in a particular proportion. Any trade, occupation, or profession is included in the partnership business. A partnership firm is simple to incorporate and requires fewer regulations than a corporation.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Partnership firms in India are handled and regulated by the Indian Partnership Act 1932. Partners are the people who join concurrently to create a partnership firm. An agreement among the partners confirms the partnership enterprise. A contract between partners that governs their relationship with one another and their relationship with the partnership firm is called as a partnership deed.
