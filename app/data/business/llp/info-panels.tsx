          A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is a form of business enterprise in which the partners are not personally liable for the debts of the partnership. An LLP can be considered as a hybrid between an incorporated company and a partnership firm. Like companies, LLPs have limited legal liability for their partners, but like partnerships, they are generally governed by contractual obligations instead of company laws.

        <p className="mb-4">There are some disadvantages to the structure of Limited Liability Partnership registration in India. Some of these disadvantages are:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>The income tax rate for LLP (30% irrespective of turnover) is higher than that of companies (25% up to ₹400 crores).</li>
          <li>Irrespective of whether the LLP is active, certain compliances have to be completed regularly after registration. If an LLP fails to do so, there is an additional penalty of ₹100 per day for each day of continuing default.</li>
          <li>There is no option for getting an equity investment.</li>
          <li>LLP has to disclose their finances to the public, which is not in the case of partnerships.</li>
          <li>Transfer of ownership rights is difficult as it requires written consent from all the partners and even one objection can make it difficult.</li>
